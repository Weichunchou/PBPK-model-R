# PBPK-model-R
This repository comprises a collection of Google colab notebooks in support of PHC 7XXX: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling in Toxicology and Risk Assessment, a course taught at the University of Florida.  

The links below display the notebooks as regular HTML web pages. From there you can run the notebook on Google Colaboratory or download to run on your own laptop. To run on your own laptop you will need to install Jupyter and Python 3, such as the excellent Anaconda distribution from Continuum Analytics.  

Please let me know (Wei at UF.edu) if you any thoughts or suggestions on how these notebooks could be improved for teaching and learning the course.

## Course Overview 
This course will discuss the fundamental principles, software, methodology and applications of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling in toxicology and human health risk assessment of environmental chemicals. Students will also learn how to integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches with PBPK modeling to support PBPK model development and applications.
